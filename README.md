Farck card game rules!

## Requirements

- 2 players: 1 deck
- 3-5 players: 2 decks, mixed
- 5+ players: 3+ decks, mixed

Aces are low. Each card has a point value equal to its number value - 8 of hearts is worth 8 points, Queen of Spades is worth 12, any Ace is worth 1. Include jokers in the deck!

## Objective

The game ends when one player plays their last card into a run. All players then count up their points. The player with the most points wins. See the scoring section for counting.

## Playing the Game

### Setup

All players are dealt 7 cards with 5 cards face-up in a row in the centre. Play proceeds clockwise from the dealer.

### Turn

Each player starts their turn by optionally laying one or more runs on the table. Runs can be three or more consecutive numbers of the same suit, such as 8-9-10 or 10-J-Q-K, or sets of the same number from different suits, such as King of hearts-King of clubs-King of spades. If more than one deck is in play, each card is considered unique, meaning that two or more of the same card can still be used in a run; an example is three lots of the King of hearts is a valid run.

Once a player has laid their first run in a game, they can start adding to other players' runs. For example, if one player has 10-J-Q of hearts, the current player can lay a King of hearts on it. The current player should put the card on the table in front of themselves and tell the other player which run they are extending.

Laying cards in runs is the only way to play a card in order to finish the game.

Each player then chooses one of three options on their turn:

1. **Draw a card**: draw a single card from the top of the deck into their hand.
2. **Burn a card**: burn a card and draw two cards from the top of the deck. Burning a card does not count as playing the card - if a player burns their last card, they should draw three cards instead of two. All "burn" cards join a discard pile; when the main draw pile is empty, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the draw pile.
3. **Trade for a card**: the player attempts to trade for a card in the middle. This initiates a **Card Trade** (see below).

Once this action is complete, the next player's turn begins.

#### Card Trade

This is a special sequence where players trade for a card in the centre. One player initiates the trade by laying a card face-down next to the card they wish to trade for. Other players can now join in the trade by laying their own cards face-down next to the card being traded for.

Once all players have joined the trade that wish to join, the players flip their cards face up. The player with the highest point card wins the trade, and swaps that card for the card in the middle. All other players lose their cards to the burn pile. In case of a draw for the highest point card, the players with the highest point card get their card back, but all other players lose their cards.

If any player plays a joker into the Card Trade, then all players involved in the trade must do the following:
1. Withdraw their card from the card trade
2. Count how many cards are in their hand
3. Discard their entire hand
4. Draw cards from the draw pile to get back to the same number as they started with

In addition, the five cards in the centre are burned, with a new set of 5 dealt from the draw pile.

Examples:
1. A single player joins the Trade. That player automatically wins and swaps their card for the centre card.
2. Two players join the trade. One plays a 5, the other plays a 7. The 7 wins, so the 5 is burned, and the player who played the 7 gets the card from the centre. The 7 joins the centre cards.
3. Three out of four players at the table join the trade. The cards are 5, 9, and 9. The 5 is burned, and the 9s are returned to the players' hands who played them. The card in the centre remains in the centre.
4. Three out of four players at the table join the trade. The cards are 6, 9, and Joker. The three players in the trade burn their hands and redraw. The centre cards are burned and redrawn. The player who did not participate in the trade keeps their current hand.

## Scoring

All players add up the point values of the cards in front of them that have been laid on runs. The player with the highest point total wins the round.
